                    MILESTONE CONTRIBUTION TO EMPLOYMENT GENERATION IN NIGERIA
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As Deputy Director Planning, Research and Statistics, I designed and developed template for monitoring, evaluation and impact
                    assessment of employment promotion schemes of the directorate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As State Coordinator, NDE Kaduna state (1988-2003), I contributed in promotion of peace and tranquility in the state through
                    massive engagement of unemployed youths in productive economic activities (counseling services, monitoring
                    skills acquisition and employment activities). This encouraged the NDE corporate headquarters in the
                    setting-up the NDE JOB CENTER.

                        <dd> - As Director PR & S, I carried out a nationwide census of unemployed persons. the field date generated
                            from the exercise immensely influenced the design of NDE’s new schemes which were relevant to
                            skills need and promotion of employability for both urban and rural unemployed.</dd>
                    </dl>
                </p>
                <p>
                    As director, small scale enterprises I adopted and adapted the international labour organization enterpreneurship development
                    training modules relevant to the peculiarities of the federation. This did not only strengthen the entrepreneurship
                    training schemes of directorate but placed on a vintage position to the extent that:

                    <dl>
                        <dd> - It provided key material relevant to Bayero university, Kano for the development of its curriculum
                            for entrepreneurship education.</dd>
                        <dd> - The NDC became a parter/facilitator for the establishment of central bank of Nigerian entrepreneurship
                            development centres (EDC’S) nationwide.</dd>

                <p>
                    Also under my leadership the Department employed and strengthen collaborative initiatives with federal government such as
                    the bank of industry, national economic reconstruction fund (NERFUND) etc. this provided NDE skills acquisition
                    training and empowerment beneficiaries with easy access to business financing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the time I took over as Director-General NDE(Nov. 2007) job creation activities in the Directorate were at lowest ebb;
                    staff morale was very low due to lack of promotion, poor staff welfare and general working conditions;
                    weak targeting of unemployed persons ; and so on
                </p>
                <p>
                    These have steadily reversed during my 8 year tenure as Director-General the Directorate is Federal Government agency that
                    proactively tackles unemployment. Some of my modest achievements include;
                </p>

                <p>
                    By the end 2007 when I came in as directorate, the directorate whose major tool for generation of mass employment opportunities
                    is skills acquisition training had no skills acquisition center of its own. Within the past 8 years in
                    addition to running our regular programmes/schemes the NDE has;
                </p>
                <p>
                    Acquired skills centers/parks as follows

                </p>

                <p>
                    Provided numerous capacity building and training opportunities both locally and internationally that reshaped the abilities
                    of staff and management of the directorate. such tours include:

                        <dd> i. Study tour for all Directors state coordinators and some programme officers to employment generation

                <p>
                    The foregoing leveraged the Directorate to design and implement impactful job creation and empowerment programmes/schemes
                    embedded with quick - wins. Some of these schemes are: The re-engineered Graduate Attachment Programme
                    (GAP) whose success lead to its adoption by SURE-P under the pseudo name Graduate Internship Scheme (GIS);
                    the NDE economic and finance counseling clinic (NDE-efcc), its profound influence lead to endorsement

                    allows secondary school leavers to make up their deficiencies towards obtaining the minimum credit passess
                    required by academic instituitions and employers of labour thereby arresting early entry into unemployment
                    under the NEET phenomena (Not in education, Employment or Training). It also provides transient jobs

                    Displaced Persons and other vulnerable groups; and so on
                </p>

                <p>

                    Lastly, even though modest achievements have been made towards strengthening the NDE, but the magnitude of the challengesof
                    unemployment in worrisome. However, I take solace with the Government of President Muhammadu Buhari’s
                    demonstrated politcal will, commitment and determination to fight unemployment and its scourge.
                </p>

                    Furthermore, I am desirous of bringing my experience to bear and be part of prgressive history by taking active part n this
                    epoch mantra of change.
